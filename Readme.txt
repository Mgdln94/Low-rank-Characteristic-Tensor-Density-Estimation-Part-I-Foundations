
### README file for the proposed density estimation framework, LRCF-DE

There are 2 main files to reproduce the experiments.
The first file, Real_data.m, is the main file which performs pointwise denisty estimation, and regression tasks.
The second file, Sampling.m, is the file that creates synthetic digit images.
Please run directly the above 2 Matlab files.

The source code was tested on Matlab Version R2019a and requires Tensorlab Version 2.02.
